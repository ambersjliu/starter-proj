# UHSCS 2022-2023 Web Development Intro Project

Hello, new student! Welcome to the world of web development. This little file is what we call a
README, and it contains important info about the project, such as how to set it up.

## Importing to Glitch

(Amber, please do this...)

## Messing around

There are a couple of important files here: `index.html` and `stylesheet.css`. The HTML file describes the *structure* of a file, while the CSS file describes its *appearance*.

Amber has heavily commented both of the aforementioned files, so take a look and mess around!
