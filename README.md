# UHSCS 2022-2023 Web Development Intro Project

Hello, new student! Welcome to the world of web development. This little file is what we call a
README, and it contains important info about the project, such as how to set it up.

## Importing to Glitch

If you're reading this README, you're probably on my (Amber's) GitHub. We're gonna import these files onto a site called Glitch,
where you can remix people's projects. The link is https://glitch.com/.

In the upper right-hand corner, click "Sign up", and make an account. When you're done, go back to the main page, and click "New project" (upper right, again).

At the bottom of the menu that pops out, click "Import from GitHub". A prompt will appear at the top of your screen asking for the link to a repository.
Paste in https://github.com/ambersjliu/starter-proj.git.

That's it! You should be all set.

(We may or may not continue to use Glitch in the future, so remember your login information!)

## Project doesn't import correctly

From the bar at the bottom of the project editor, click Tools > Import/Export, then click "Import from Github". 
The site will prompt you to enter a GitHub repo link. Paste in https://github.com/ambersjliu/starter-proj.git.

## Messing around

There are a couple of important files here: `index.html` and `stylesheet.css`. The HTML file describes the *structure* of a file, while the CSS file describes its *appearance*.

Amber has heavily commented both of the aforementioned files, so take a look and mess around!
